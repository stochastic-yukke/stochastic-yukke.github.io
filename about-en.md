# About this site
Welcome to my website!<br>
I am a high school student, mainly interested in Mathematics.<br>
On this website, I write:
- Archives(A collection of PDFs focused on mathematics),
- Marginalia(A collection of memos focused on mathematics),
- Street & Trail(Records of Hikes and Walks).
<br>

This site's theme colour is Cosmic Latte `#FFF8E7`.<br>

Currently, this site is available only in Japanese. &gt;&gt; I hope to provide English content in the future!
