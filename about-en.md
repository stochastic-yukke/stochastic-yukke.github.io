# About this site
Welcome to my website!<br>
I am a high school student in Japan, mainly interested in Mathematics.<br>
On this website, I write:
- Archives(A collection of PDFs focused on mathematics),
- Marginalia(A collection of memos focused on mathematics),
- Street-Trail(Records of Hikes and Walks).
<br>
Currently, this site is available only in Japanese. I hope to provide English content in the future.
